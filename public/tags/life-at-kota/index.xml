&lt;h3 id=&#34;my-kota-journey&#34;&gt;My Kota Journey
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;about&#34;&gt;About
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This series comprises my story and experiences in Kota. This is the first part of the story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;photo-container&#34; style=&#34;width: 80%; max-width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 2px solid #ddd; border-radius: 10px; overflow: hidden; box-shadow: 0 4px 8px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);&#34;&gt;

  &lt;p class=&#34;photo-caption&#34; style=&#34;padding: 10px; font-style: italic; color:red; text-align: center; background-color: #f9f9f9;&#34;&gt;Kota city&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ah, Kota! üåü A name that resonates with every JEE aspirant. When people think of this city, what image comes to mind? Serious students poring over books, bustling coaching centers, and an environment brimming with competition and pressure. This is what Kota means to many. üìöüè´&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But is that the whole story?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-is-reality&#34;&gt;What is Reality?
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reality of Kota is quite different. It&amp;rsquo;s a city like any other, filled with dreams and aspirations. Having spent almost a year here, I&amp;rsquo;ve seen the ground reality. Coaching institutes operate like educational business giants, teachers are treated like products, and top rankers are the showcases for prospective students. Some students are extremely serious, some are more relaxed, and I find myself somewhere in between, leaning slightly towards the chilled side. I&amp;rsquo;ve learned that no place is special, and no coaching can replace self-confidence and self-study. If you&amp;rsquo;re serious about your studies, you can crack any exam, anywhere, whether it&amp;rsquo;s online or offline. üí™üìñ&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;greed&#34;&gt;Greed?
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kota is a city driven by student demand, where local shopkeepers, from small vendors to big showrooms, aim to benefit from the student population. The greed is most noticeable in areas densely populated by students. Venturing into local markets reveals significantly lower prices for the same goods. The issue lies with students who don‚Äôt bargain, allowing shopkeepers to take advantage. Everything from room rent to basic groceries, from rubber bands to soap and shampoos, is costly here. The only reasonably priced items are books, notebooks, and study materials. üìöüí∏&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;drugs-suicides-and-environment&#34;&gt;Drugs, Suicides, and Environment?
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;During my time in Kota, I didn&amp;rsquo;t encounter anyone involved in drugs or other illicit activities, but I did come across mobile thieves. If you talk openly in the streets with your phone, you risk losing it. The environment is decent in terms of facilities, but if you come here alone expecting to make friends and find healthy competition, think again. The competition is toxic, and everyone is focused on their own success. You‚Äôll rarely find anyone willing to help unless you have old friends here (I was lucky to have some üòä‚ù§Ô∏è). Making new friends is tough as everyone is so engrossed in their studies, leaving no room for social life. If you get social, you risk getting distracted by the many attractions Kota offers. This intense competition and stress contribute to the alarming rate of suicides. Emotional resilience is crucial here; if you&amp;rsquo;re emotionally weak, bring someone along to support you morally and physically. üö´üß†&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-new-start&#34;&gt;A New Start
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;beginning-hostel-search-and-admission&#34;&gt;Beginning Hostel Search and Admission
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;I arrived in Kota in April and enrolled at Allen Career Institute. The excitement of attending tuition classes for the first time was palpable. The city&amp;rsquo;s greed was evident from the moment we arrived at the Railway Station, where auto drivers were ready to overcharge us. We fell prey to this on our first day. The auto ride took 30 minutes, dropping us at the grand Sankalp building, Allen&amp;rsquo;s main office. I was awestruck by the multi-story coaching institute, resembling a castle. We went inside to secure our admission. Although our 12th-grade results were pending, the lady at the counter asked, &amp;ldquo;Are you sure you&amp;rsquo;ll get more than 75% marks?&amp;rdquo; My friends, Pushpraj and Chakku, were confident, but I had doubts due to a challenging exam environment. We completed the admission process and began our hostel search. After several attempts, we found a hostel. Despite my initial reluctance, Pushpraj, his parents, and my parents saw it as ideal. I later realized they were right. Our hostel, a mix of PG and hostel, had no strict rules. We had the freedom to come and go, bring food to our rooms, and host friends. üè®üè∞&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;photo-container&#34; style=&#34;width: 80%; max-width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 2px solid #ddd; border-radius: 10px; overflow: hidden; box-shadow: 0 4px 8px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);&#34;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;my-room&#34;&gt;My Room
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our room was spacious, equipped with a separate washroom, AC, fan, study table, blackboard, cupboard, and beds ‚Äì all in pairs for the two of us. Our parents left the same day, leaving us on our own. We began making friends and met a junior named Sameer, our neighbor. We chatted with him to get a feel of the hostel. After shopping for necessary items, we returned and rested until evening. I started wondering if Kota, notorious for suicides, had any lingering spirits in our room. Instead of feeling scared, I felt a sense of adventure. I joked to Pushpraj, &amp;ldquo;Let&amp;rsquo;s beat that ghost&amp;rsquo;s a**!&amp;rdquo; (As Navodayans, we had faced &amp;ldquo;ghost encounters&amp;rdquo; orchestrated by seniors trying to scare us, so we weren&amp;rsquo;t easily frightened. Navodaya is another story for another time). To our amusement, there was no ghost. Suddenly, we heard someone eavesdropping at our door. It turned out to be Aryan (another neighbor) and Sameer, attempting to scare us. We told them such antics wouldn&amp;rsquo;t work on us and urged them to try something bigger. We laughed, chatted, and then went for dinner. With excitement for the next day, we went to bed. üõèÔ∏èüëª&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;a-new-day&#34;&gt;A New Day
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next day began with a mix of seriousness and curiosity. We were in a new world, unfamiliar with the coaching culture. How we navigated this new environment and what challenges we faced, I‚Äôll share in the next part of my journey. Until then, goodbye! üåû‚ú®&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;My journey in Kota has been a rollercoaster of emotions, experiences, and lessons. From initial excitement to harsh realities, it has been a path of self-discovery and growth. Remember, no place is inherently special, and no coaching institute can replace self-confidence and self-study. üöÄüìö&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the first part of my Kota journey! This series is all about the highs, lows, and everything in between during my time as a JEE aspirant in Kota. Let‚Äôs dive into the whirlwind that was my first day in this city of dreams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-start-of-a-new-chapter-&#34;&gt;The Start of a New Chapter üìñ
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The excitement of starting a new chapter kept me awake all night. With barely any sleep, I jumped out of bed, fueled by the determination to make this year count. &amp;ldquo;This is it,&amp;rdquo; I thought to myself. &amp;ldquo;This is my time to shine.&amp;rdquo; üåü&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a quick brush, my roommate Pushpraj and I decided to grab breakfast. My stomach was already doing somersaults‚Äîthanks to the nerves, I guess! ü•¥ Breakfast was pasta, a dish I usually love, but this time it tasted like anything but. A stomachache soon followed, but a cup of tea worked wonders. With new dreams brewing in our minds, we headed out for our first day at coaching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-coaching-hunt-&#34;&gt;The Coaching Hunt üè´
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kota‚Äôs coaching centers are massive‚Äîfour buildings with more than 20 rooms each! üè¢ But where do we start? Our junior, Sameer, advised us to download an app called Allen Digital to check our class schedules. However, after struggling to get authorized in the app, we were left clueless and stressed. üòì&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our friend Sandarbh then suggested heading to the main office for help. We arrived early, only to find out that the person who could assist us wouldn‚Äôt be there until 11 a.m. More waiting‚Ä¶ ‚è≥&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-stranger-friend-or-foe&#34;&gt;A stranger friend or foe
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While waiting, I struck up a conversation with a student from Haryana. To my surprise, he was there to collect his transfer certificate‚Äîhe was leaving Kota! üò≤&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He explained that the atmosphere in Kota was too toxic for him. He had seen students engaging in habits like smoking and chewing gutka, which made him uncomfortable. Feeling lonely and out of place, he decided to leave after just a week. His story made us question our decision to come to Kota in the first place. Was this really the right choice? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;coaching-allotment&#34;&gt;Coaching Allotment
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;After a while, when the sir finally arrived at his office, we were called in by a kind lady. There we were‚Äîthree friends: me, Pushpraj, and Chakku (aka Abhishek Chakravarti)‚Äînervously hoping for the same coaching room assignment. ü§û&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One by one, we were called inside. First up was Pushpraj. When he came back, he told us he got the TLO1BX1 coaching room with an afternoon shift. &amp;ldquo;Phew! That&amp;rsquo;s not too bad,&amp;rdquo; I thought. Next, it was Chakku&amp;rsquo;s turn. He wished hard to be in the same room as Pushpraj, but when he came back, his face said it all‚Äîpale and disappointed. üòû He had been assigned to the Samarth building, while Pushpraj&amp;rsquo;s room was in Sankalp. The disappointment was clear; this wasn&amp;rsquo;t what we hoped for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, it was my turn. üò¨ I walked in, feeling the pressure. Two sirs sat next to each other and asked for my application number and attendance card. After a brief moment, they mentioned that the previous student was from the same region as me, and I nodded in acknowledgment. Then came the moment of truth‚Äîthey said I got the TL01BX1 room and the second shift. WHAT?! I was stunned‚Äîhow did I manage to get the exact same room as Pushpraj? üò≤&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given that there were about 100,000 students at that time, and each room could accommodate a maximum of 150 students, the odds of this happening were astronomical. But somehow, it did! I walked out of that office with a big smile on my face, excitedly sharing the news with my friends. They were just as shocked and surprised as I was. How did I end up in the same room and shift as Pushpraj? Only the universe knows! üåå&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With our enrollments sorted, we were finally able to log into Allen Digital. We noticed that classes were starting at 1 PM, but it was already 12 PM. So, we all agreed to skip the first day and start fresh the next day. üéí&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here is our really nice image&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;photo-container&#34; style=&#34;width: 80%; max-width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 2px solid #ddd; border-radius: 10px; overflow: hidden; box-shadow: 0 4px 8px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);&#34;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;afternoon&#34;&gt;Afternoon
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;After arriving at the hostel, we headed straight for lunch. üçΩÔ∏è Today‚Äôs treat was gobhi ke parathas, and they were absolutely delicious! üòã I stuffed myself to the brim and then took a nap, as I was already feeling sleepy from not getting enough rest. üò¥&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later, Pushpraj woke me up and told me we were heading to the temple. üïâÔ∏è&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-temple-scence&#34;&gt;The Temple Scence
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I woke up, refreshed my face, and got ready to head out with Pushpraj. üåü Sameer and Aryan joined us as our guides to the temple. üïå&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On our way, I noticed why Kota is often seen as a distracting place for students. üòÖ I saw a couple walking along the streets, and it seemed like some students were caught up in distractions rather than focusing on their studies. At first, I thought they were just friends, but as I observed more closely, it seemed like it was getting out of hand. ü§î&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I shook off those thoughts and headed straight into the temple to seek blessings. üôè I asked the gods to give me strength to overcome every obstacle and succeed in my journey. üåü‚ú®&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;day-over&#34;&gt;Day Over
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;And just like that, the first day came to an end. üåÖ We enjoyed a delicious dinner, made some fascinating new friends at the hostel, and embarked on a few more adventures. üçΩÔ∏èüéâ&lt;/p&gt;
